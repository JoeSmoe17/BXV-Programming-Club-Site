				<b>Terry Pratchett</b> - <br> <i>Always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual.</i> 
			</p>

				<b>Douglas Adams</b> - <br> <i>In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Randel Monroe</b> - <br> <i>I used to work at NASA in Virginia. It was nothing glamorous; I was just tasked with making code compile for obscure projects, and I wasn't very good at it. Now I spend most of my time drawing pictures and looking at funny things on the Internet, which in retrospect is largely what I did at my old job, too.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Alan Turing</b> - <br> <i>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Rich Kulawiec</b> - <br> <i>Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.</i>
